About a week ago, I tried to start a wiki site for this project in order to
allow collaboration and easier updates for continuously updated resources on
this website, such as the Russian resource catalog and the SSM (now
VocabSieve) setup tutorial.

The Wiki is now live on https://wiki.freelanguagetools.org. It is based on
[DokuWiki](https://dokuwiki.org), which is a lightweight, file-based wiki
engine that is much simpler compared to MediaWiki (the wiki engine that powers
Wikipedia). 

As of now, only the VocabSieve setup tutorial has been transfered over there.
The remaining content will be moved in due time, with the needed updates. 

If you would like to contribute to the Wiki, please register and start
editing! Doing so would help more learners access these resources.

Again, if you have any questions, you are welcome to use one of the chatrooms
listed on the sidebar.
