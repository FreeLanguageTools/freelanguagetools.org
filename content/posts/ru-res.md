Here is a compiled list of immersion-based learning resources for
Russian, some of which I have used myself.

## Textbooks
Name | URL | File Type | Note 
--- | --- | --- | ---
The New Penguin Russian Course | [libgen](http://library.lol/main/706B984105FD0B0B3831411EE7B40741) | PDF | This book covers pretty much all basic grammar concepts you'll need. Do note that it's somewhat dated and some descriptions may no longer be accurate (One thing being the postal address system, which is no longer used)

## Anki decks
[ru15k v2.1 - Targeted Sentence Cards for 15000 Russian words](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/563580199)

I made this deck myself, because I could not find any satisfactory ones. The
2.0 version has much fewer errors and significantly better coverage.

## Books
Simply search the title of the book online and add скачать ("download") or
читать онлайн ("read online"). It is significantly easier to find resources
than by making equivalent queries in English. Try reading translations of English books or Japanese light novels if you find native writing too difficult.

Tip: Read novels of the anime series you watched. You would know the basic plot but it would still have a lot of extra details to keep it interesting. They are very easy to find on Runet.

## TV shows
Refer to the
[Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aBpfxVgUJ-OuUtCJDkfb_jVqKoUOSBSPxdc60bCjQw4/edit#gid=0)
for more complete information.

Some subtitles are available for download from [MEGA folder](https://mega.nz/folder/WoVlCKTS#s76jwtC_hvt6KVPMeC8M3g).

Only native subtitled shows are listed here. If you can go without subtitles, we assume you have the ability to find things by yourself. You can also watch dubbed shows, but do not expect them to have any subtitles either.

If a show you want to watch is not listed here, it may still have subtitles. Try these websites:
[1](https://www.opensubtitles.org/)
[2](https://subs.com.ru/)
[3](https://subtitry.ru/)

You can also get condensed audio files for some of these shows [here](https://mega.nz/folder/W480jCqZ#Pu1Pnvy7l0IFweRnlg5bPQ) for passive listening.

**NOTE**: If only some seasons of a specific show is listed here, it means the
other ones do not have subtitles.

## Youtube Channels
Note: "Subtitles" always mean Russian subtitles
### Learner oriented
I recommend watching most of the videos in these channels in the following order (except FAQ or livestreams, which often have lower audio quality). The last two are similar in difficulty. You should aim to first watch the grammar channel once to familiarize yourself with the grammatical categories, and re-watch whenever you feel the need for it or any sort of confusion. 
|Name|Subtitles?|Difficulty|Notes|
-----|----------|----------|-----|
|[Russian grammar](https://www.youtube.com/c/russiangrammar)| N/A | English-language explanations of Russian grammar. 
|[Comprehensible Russian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDNbk-uX4D6nsthi8L03fng)|Rare, but difficult words are often on written on the screen.| Zero - Beginner | Talks very slowly, good for absolute beginners with zero vocabulary.|
|[Russian with Max](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCklUqFEcJqFnWKEBozw5p4g) |Yes| Beginner - Intermediate |Talks slowly and clearly, good for beginners. Some episodes has more advanced content.|

### General audience
TV news channels are not included in the list below. You can find them easily elsewhere. If you decide to watch news, avoid consuming too much state-owned or state-aligned news, such as RT, РИА Новости, or Россия 1.

## Podcasts for learners
In general these are more difficult than learning youtube videos, because
there is no visual reference.

Most podcasts for general audiences are quite difficult to understand due to
fast speech and the lack of visual cues, so we do not list them here.

__Criteria__:
- Has to be almost entirely in Russian, no substantial passages in other
  languages
- Most episodes has to be available without a paywall.
