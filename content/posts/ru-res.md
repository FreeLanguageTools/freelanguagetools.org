Here is a compiled list of primarily immersion based learning resources for
Russian, some of which I have used myself.

## Textbooks
Name | URL | File Type | Note 
--- | --- | --- | ---
The New Penguin Russian Course | [libgen](http://library.lol/main/706B984105FD0B0B3831411EE7B40741) | PDF | This book covers pretty much all basic grammar concepts you'll need. Do note that it's somewhat dated and some descriptions may no longer be accurate (One thing being the postal address system, which is no longer used)

## Anki decks
[10000 Targeted Russian Sentences with Definitions](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/480545875)

I recommend it because I made it myself (I might detail the process in a later
post). Note that the sentences come from Tatoeba, which is not a highly
reliable source. Moreover, the processing is not perfect. If you find a card
weird or too difficult, feel free to delete or suspend.

## Books
Simply search the title of the book online and add скачать ("download") or
читать онлайн ("read online"). It is significantly easier to find resources
than by making equivalent queries in English.

## TV shows
Refer to the
[Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aBpfxVgUJ-OuUtCJDkfb_jVqKoUOSBSPxdc60bCjQw4/edit#gid=0)
for more complete information.

Some subtitles are available for download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nY1_K9h6bCKC5fqjZrV9tKCDiufHAoCZ?usp=sharing)

Only subtitled shows are listed here. If you can go without subtitles, we
assume you have the ability to find things by yourself.

**NOTE**: If only some seasons of a specific show is listed here, it means the
other ones are not subtitles.

## Podcasts for learners
In general these are more difficult than learning youtube videos, because
there is no visual reference.

Most podcasts for general audiences are quite difficult to understand due to
fast speech and the lack of visual cues, so we do not list them here.

__Criteria__:
- Has to be almost entirely in Russian, no substantial passages in other
  languages
- Most episodes has to be available without a paywall.
